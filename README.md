# JSWebshop
A webshop made in JS

I made this webshop to get a better understanding on how and when to use Javascript, and to see if it was possible to remove some load from the server and put it on the client.

The program is not even close to done, but all the bacis suff works like:
  - Sort in item
  - Put things in the basket
  - Login through Facebook
  
Stuff the program needs:
  - You can't place a order
  - A real login system (without facebook)
